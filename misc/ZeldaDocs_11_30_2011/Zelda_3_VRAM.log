Module 7 (Dungeon) and Module 9 (Overworld)

$0000-$1FFF BG2 Tilemap

$2000-$3FFF BG1 Tilemap

$4000-$7FFF 4bpp Tiles for BG0 and BG1 [They share :) ]

$8000-$BFFF Sprite Graphics Memory

	Sprite graphics can be seen as divided in half. Areas that have 0's as sprite
	indexes will not overwrite the graphics from the previous screen. This
	can cause inconsistent behavior though, so be careful.

	--------------------------------------------------
	$8000-$87FF Reserved Sprite Memory (Slot 0)

	This region contains Link's body's current sprites, as well as various other essential sprites
	that can't easily be taken out of memory. e.g. rupees, the sword and shield, etc.

	$8800-$9FFF Locale Specific Graphics (Slots 1 - 3)

	"Locale" in this sense can be one of three things: Dark World, Light World, or 
	inside a Dungeon. This will determine what the pots and bushes you pick up look like,
	(rocks as well) 

	$A000-$BFFF Room / Area Specific Graphics (Slots 4 - 7)

	Every overworld area and dungeon room has a graphics number that tells the game
	which sprite graphics to load dynamically.

$C000-$DFFF BG3 Tilemap

$E000-$FFFF 2bpp Tiles for BG2 [This is the Heads up Display and Menu, etc]

    $F800-$FFFF - used for text message data

	- note that graphics packs 6A, 69, and 68 are used with srctypeone for this
