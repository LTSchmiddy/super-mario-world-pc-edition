    In conjunction with the above variable when set to 0x13, matching the above
    variable, the cape transformation is complete.
                
    This indicates which secondary item is equipped (aka Y-button
    item).

***************************
I think these are the addresses for if you have items unlocked. Not sure what's what though.
So far, I think that they just go left to right, line by line, of the UI I use in redux, like reading.
    7EF340 = Bow
    7EF341 = Boomerang
    7EF342 = Hookshot
    7EF343 = Bombs (Number of)
    7EF344
    7EF345
    7EF346
    7EF347
    7EF348
    7EF349
    7EF34A = Lantern
    7EF34B = Hammer
    7EF34C
    7EF34D
    7EF34E
    7EF34F
    7EF350

	This code is for the bottles. Replace 00 with:
01 - a mushroom
02 - an empty bottle
03 - red potion
04 - green potion
05 - blue potion
06 - a fairy
07 - a friendly bee
08 - a rare friendly bee

Next, I wanna know where the Player's Health and Magic is stored:
I think this is what I need?

Health:             7EF36C. Goal (capacity) Health. Each increment of $08 is worth one heart.
                          $04 is a half heart. The max is generally $A0. 
                          The game is coded to not accept health values beyond this.
                  
                    7EF36D. Actual Health. Same as above, but this reflects
                          your current health status rather than potential.

Magic Power:        7EF36E. Magic power ranges from 0 to $80 (128). Each small bottle refills $10. 
                        Setting Magic above $80 causes the magic meter to glitch and you can't 
                        use special items.

Address of arrow count = 7EF377

06D0F9EA: Item drops from enemies never disappear
7E004810: Link Automatically pushes objects
0790B927: No charge for dash

***************************
This will be handy for strafing:
$50[0x01] - (Player)
    
    A flag indicating whether a change of the direction Link is facing is possible.
    For example, when the B button is held down with a sword.
    
    0        - Can change
    non zero - Can't change.
    
7E002F[0x01] - (Player)

    0 - up
    2 - down
    4 - left
    6 - right.
    
    The direction the player is currently facing. Other values should be
    considered invalid. Mirrored at 7E0323
